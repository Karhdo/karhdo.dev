## Hello, folks! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Trong Khanh (aka Karhdo)

I have a passion for **JavaScript/Typescript** and website development.
I'm currently a fullstack developer at **YouNet Media**, deeply engaged in the **EcomHeat** project, which entails market share management, competitor research, and fostering e-commerce growth.
I work mainly with **Javascript**, **Typescript**, **React**, **NodeJS**, **NestJS**, and **NextJS**.

## Why have this blog?

> My desire to practice my skills and share my acquired knowledge fuels my endeavors.

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and taking notes helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. I hope my blog can be a useful resource for fellow web developers.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and comments on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.

## Tech stack

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

This blog site takes inspiration from leohuynh.dev. I appreciate [Leo Huynh](https://twitter.com/hta218_) and [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for their contribution to this minimal, lightweight, and highly customizable blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="atom-symbol" /> Upgrading to **React 18**, **Next 13**.

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="party-popper" /> Adopting **Typescript**, committing with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="bar-chart" /> Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/) website analytics

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="eyes" /> Theming in dark mode with [Tokyonight Neovim Theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
  colors for better contrast.

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="man-technologist" /> My website refers to the design and code from the [lehuynh.dev](https://github.com/hta218/leohuynh.dev)
  repository and incorporates the tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog template, version 1.0.

- <Twemoji className="mr-2" emoji="inbox-tray" /> Bumping up `mdx-bundler`, `rehype`/`remark` plugins and dependencies to
  the latest version
