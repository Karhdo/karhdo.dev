## Hello, folks! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving-hand" /> I'm Hemant Manwani

I have a passion for **Golang, .NET** and backend development.
I'm currently working as a Engineering Lead at **LoginRadius LLP**, deeply engaged in the **CIAM** project.
I work mainly with **Golang**, **.NET**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **NodeJS**.

## Why have this blog?

> My desire to practice my skills and share my acquired knowledge fuels my endeavors.

I created this blog to document and share the insights and practical knowledge I’ve gained throughout my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and taking notes not only reinforces my understanding of new concepts and technologies but also allows me to reflect on my learning process. My hope is that this blog serves as a valuable resource for fellow web developers.

I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on my posts—your comments mean a lot to me!<Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
