## Introduction

In this blog post, we examine the intricate challenges encountered in the development of applications at medium and large scales.

## Application Issues

From medium to large-scale applications, challenges like architecture maintenance and scalability hinder progress. So, What challenges typically arise as an application scales from medium to large size ?

### Lack of common architecture

When it comes to developing applications, one of the persistent challenges developers encounter is the absence of a common, standardized architecture.

- **Maintenance Challenges**: With diverse architectural choices, maintaining and updating applications becomes arduous.

- **Code Quality and Readability**: Inconsistent architectures often result in code that's hard to follow.

- **Collaboration Hurdles**: When each developer follows their preferred architectural pattern, collaboration among team members becomes cumbersome.

### Weakness structure

- **Code Reusability**: Without predefined patterns or modules, developers often face hurdles when attempting to reuse code across different sections of the application.

- **Non-standard Type Validation**: Avoid conducting validation prior to storing data in the database or validating the data received from the API.

### Scalability problem

As projects grow, the absence of a common architecture can hinder scalability. Without standardized patterns, scaling applications becomes intricate, leading to poor performance.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our exploration of challenges in medium to large-scale application development underscores the critical need for standardized architecture.

In the next post, I will introduce **NestJS**. This framework can help you address the issues mentioned earlier: **NestJS**, a robust **NodeJS framework**, proves instrumental in addressing issues such as maintenance complexities, weak structures, and scalability hurdles.
