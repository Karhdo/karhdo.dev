## Introduction

In any application involving booking hotel rooms, flight seats, or similar resources, **data integrity** is crucial to ensure multiple users can’t “claim” the same slot concurrently. We need an effective way to handle **concurrency** so that two (or more) customers placing a near-simultaneous booking don’t exceed the actual available count.

This post will cover **three** popular techniques in SQL:

1. **Pessimistic Lock** using `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.
2. **Optimistic Lock** using a `version` (or timestamp) column.
3. **Transaction Isolation Level**, especially `SERIALIZABLE`.
4. **Advanced solutions**, e.g., distributed locks, caching, etc.

## Pessimistic Lock: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`

**Pessimistic lock** assumes “**conflicts are likely**,” so it locks rows before updating to prevent other transactions from interfering. A typical example in SQL (with InnoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) is:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- Lock the row and read data
SELECT available
FROM rooms
WHERE room_type = 'Deluxe'
FOR UPDATE;

-- Check if available > 0
UPDATE rooms
SET available = available - 1
WHERE room_type = 'Deluxe';
COMMIT;
```

### How it works

- `FOR UPDATE` **locks** the matching rows (assuming row-level locking in InnoDB).
- If another transaction also tries to operate on `room_type = 'Deluxe'` using a similar statement, it will **wait** until the first transaction finishes (COMMIT or ROLLBACK).
- This prevents both transactions from reading `available = 5` and decrementing it to 4 and 3, respectively, at the same time. Instead, the second transaction is blocked and only sees the updated state after the first transaction commits.

### Pros & Cons

- **Pros**:
  - Straightforward and easy to implement.
  - Very clear for preventing concurrency issues.
- **Cons**:
  - If there’s a high volume of concurrent updates, this approach may cause **blocking** (waiting) and degrade performance.
  - At very large scale, pessimistic locking can become a bottleneck.

For **small- to medium-sized** applications, **`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`** is typically sufficient, ensuring correctness without too much overhead.

## Optimistic Lock: Using a `version` Column

By contrast, **Optimistic Lock** assumes “**conflicts are rare**” and doesn’t lock rows during read. Instead, it checks for conflicts at **update time** by using a `version` (or timestamp) column to see whether any changes occurred in the meantime.

### Implementation

1. **Create the table** with a `version` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rooms (
	room_type VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
	available INT NOT NULL,
	version   INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

2. **When reading** (before booking), fetch the `version`:

```sql
SELECT available, version
FROM rooms
WHERE room_type = 'Deluxe';
-- No FOR UPDATE here
```

3. **On update**, include the old `version` in the `WHERE` clause. For instance:

```sql
UPDATE rooms
SET available = available - 1,
    version   = version + 1
WHERE room_type = 'Deluxe'
  AND version = :old_version
  AND available > 0;

```

- If **one row** is updated, everything is fine (no conflict).
- If **zero rows** are updated, it indicates a conflict: someone else has changed `version` (or `available` is now zero). The application should then reload the latest data or handle the failure gracefully.

### Pros & Cons

- **Pros**:
  - No “hard” blocking – others can continue reading/updating.
  - Good for read-heavy, write-light scenarios.
- **Cons**:
  - If there are frequent simultaneous writes, many transactions may fail their update and have to retry.
  - Slightly more complex logic, as the application must handle the “0 rows updated” scenario.

**Optimistic Lock** can offer higher **throughput** compared to a pessimistic lock when the rate of **conflict** is low. But if conflicts are common, you may end up handling lots of retries.

## Using the Transaction Isolation Level: `SERIALIZABLE`

Another technique is to run transactions under the highest **isolation level**: `SERIALIZABLE`. In this mode, the database ensures the outcome is equivalent to running the transactions sequentially, with no overlaps.

### Usage

You can change the isolation level when starting the transaction. For example, in MySQL:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
START TRANSACTION;

SELECT available
FROM rooms
WHERE room_type = 'Deluxe';

-- Check and update
UPDATE rooms
SET available = available - 1
WHERE room_type = 'Deluxe';

COMMIT;
```

### Pros & Cons

- **Pros**:
  - Very robust: the database enforces a “serial” schedule, preventing anomalies.
  - Minimal code changes if everything is done at `SERIALIZABLE` level.
- **Cons**: - Increased blocking or frequent rollbacks due to conflicts at this high level. - Potentially severe performance impact under heavy concurrency.
  Hence, **SERIALIZABLE** is chosen sparingly, usually when data integrity is paramount and high contention is less of a concern.

## Advanced Solutions: Distributed Locks, Caching, and More

At **large scale** (multiple database nodes, microservices, or extremely high transaction volume), you may need techniques beyond a single SQL database:

1. **Distributed locks** via **Redis**, ZooKeeper, or Consul.
2. **Message queues** to serialize booking requests so that only one booking action is processed at a time.
3. **Eventual consistency** models if a small delay in updating availability is acceptable.
   These techniques can handle throughput beyond the capacity of a single SQL server. They also introduce more complexity and potentially new failure modes (like distributed consensus issues).

## Conclusion: Which Method to Choose?

Your choice depends on **scale** and **requirements**:

- **Small to Medium**: **Pessimistic Lock** (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) + transactions is clear, straightforward, and effective.
- **Medium to Larger**: Consider **Optimistic Lock** (version columns) if read volume is high compared to writes, and you can manage potential update failures.
- **Strict Consistency Needs**: **SERIALIZABLE** isolation level.
- **Huge Scale**: Look into **distributed solutions** – locks in Redis, message-queue-based booking, or other microservices patterns.

Regardless of the approach, the **core** principle remains:

1. Detect if there is available capacity (e.g., rooms, seats).
2. Update it **atomically** (all or nothing).
3. Ensure that two concurrent transactions can’t both update old data.

Using a single SQL database with transactions can be enough for many use cases. Once the system grows beyond what a single database can handle, you can step into the world of distributed locks and advanced architectures.
